# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Louise's U.S. Play Campaign
  Upon analysis of collected data via kickstarter campaigns from around the world, then specifically the US and Great Britain - we were able to conclude that in order to optimize Louise's odds of successfully funding her US kickstarter, she should lower her goal amount closer to a more common goal of success. 
   - According to analysis, her plans for a $12,000.00 USD play campaign sits above the upper quartile + 1.5*IQR ($10,250.00 USD). 
   - In fact, of the 5 kickstarters for plays she's been specifically inspired by (Be Prepared, Checkpoint 22, etc.), the average goal sits at $2,100.00 USD - vastly under her expected $12,000.00 USD goal. 
 
 The attached line graph also suggests a campaign launch for her play would be most effective in the early summer months of May or June.

## Louise's Musical in Great Britain
  In the case of Louise's British musical ambitions; a campaign goal of 4,000.00 GBP would be higher than the most commonly succesful musical campaigns in Great Britain. The box & whisker plot attached illustrates UK Musical goals vs UK Musical pledges - those goals slightly under 2,000.00 GBP have a significantly greater chance of succesful pledge amounts.

  ## Conclusion
  Louise would be advised to lower both of her goals by at least an amount over $2,000.00 USD and 2,000.00 GBP. It would also be advised that Louis launch her US campaign in the early summer time of May or June.
